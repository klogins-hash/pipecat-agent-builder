## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Quick Start**

### **Option 1: Use Deployed Version**
Visit the live app: [Your Railway URL]
- Click the microphone and start talking!
- Or use the form builder as backup

### **Option 2: Run Locally**

**Backend (Python):**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd pipecat-agent-builder

# Install Python dependencies  
pip install -r requirements-railway.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Add your API keys to .env

# Start the server
python web_app.py
```

**Frontend (React + Pipecat):**
```bash
# In a new terminal
cd client

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Start the React dev server  
npm run dev
```

```

## üéØ **How It Works**

### **Voice Mode (Recommended)**

1. **Click the microphone** - Start a voice conversation
2. **Describe your agent** - "I need a sales bot for my SaaS company"
3. **Natural follow-up** - AI asks about channels, features, personality
4. **Code generation** - Creates complete Pipecat application
5. **Download & deploy** - Get ZIP with all files ready for production

### **Form Mode (Fallback)**

1. **Fill out the form** - Structured input for agent requirements
2. **Submit details** - Specify channels, languages, use case
3. **Generate agent** - AI creates the complete application
4. **Download files** - Get your production-ready agent

## üìö **Example Voice Prompts**

### Customer Service Bot
*"Create a customer service agent for my e-commerce store that can track orders, handle returns, answer product questions, and escalate to humans when needed. I need it to support both English and Spanish."*

### Restaurant Assistant  
*"Build a phone agent for my Italian restaurant that takes reservations, answers menu questions, handles takeout orders, and provides directions. It should have a warm, friendly personality."*

### Sales Assistant
*"I need a sales bot for my SaaS company that can qualify leads, schedule demos, answer pricing questions, and integrate with our CRM. It should sound professional but approachable."*
